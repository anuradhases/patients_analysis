## Project Overview
The following is a statistical analysis for 33,865 patients. The goal is to provide insights of two sub-groups (pre-auth and direct booking) patients including: appointments booked within 1-week, rescheduling rates, and gender and age distributions. Limitations of analysis and assumptions were made, to provide accurate statistical analyses.

## Data Source
The data was sourced from external sources, and consists of two sheets: pre-authorized patients, and patients with appointments. “Pre-authorized patients” is a dataset consisting of patients that are pre-authorized to book an appointment. “Patients with appointments” is a dataset consisting of all patients (direct booking and pre-authorized) that have booked an appointment. 

## Key Insights:

- There is a total of 33,865 patients with 99.8% as pre-authorized and 0.2% as direct booking. <br>
- There is a significant difference in rescheduling rate between pre-authorized patients versus direct booking patients (15% vs 1%), as well as in average days for rescheduling (17 days vs 1 day). <br>

***Pre-Authorized Patients*** <br>
- Overall 13% of pre-authorized patients book their appointment within one week of coverage. <br>
- 15% of pre-authorized patients reschedule their appointment, with an average of 17 days. <br>
- Pre-authorized patients are 68% female, and 32% male. <br>
- On average, 70% of each gender book an appointment. <br>
- Majority of female pre-authorized patients (50%) are between ages 3 and 14, and 21 and 30. <br>
- Majority of male pre-authorized patients (50%) are between ages 3 and 14, and 30 and 40. <br>

***Direct Booking Patients*** <br>
